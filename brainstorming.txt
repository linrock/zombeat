Achievements: ppl like to stick around until they reach a goal or finish an achievement. SHow a list of possible achievements. During teh game, notify the user of any completed achievements and at the end of teh game, summarize their achievements and the ones they weren't able to get. 

Character creation: make it more personable and get users attached to their characters. (e.g. choose their character's name, and label the character on screen with his name)

enemies: they only come up to the player and dmg by touching. have some animation where they blow up or something (could reuse their spawning animation)

Have to be able to finish the level (need to wait until already mentioned features/powerups are implemented to test this). 

add other enemies on diff levels.

not too easy, not too difficult. 1) choose difficulty or 2) make progressively difficult, or visit previous levels with challenges

what makes Tilt To Live so addicting? 
    High scores, different power ups, barely avoiding obstacles is exciting. combo points/multiplier

make it so u can hold down space bar because it gets tiring. don't want the player to get physically tired of playing. if it's too powerful, slow down the max firing speed.
